# Elements C++ GUI library

![alt Photon Sampler](images/photon_sampler.jpg)

## Introduction

Elements is a lightweight, fine-grained, HDPI capable, resolution independent, modular GUI library, designed with these requirements in mind:

1. It should be open source with a liberal, non-viral license.
2. It should be usable in any application and should play well
   with other GUI libraries and frameworks.
3. Corollary to the second requirement is that it can also be used
   to develop plugins (e.g. it should not own the event loop and can
   co-exist with elements within a plugin host such as VST and AU.
4. It should be resolution independent and allows for HDPI displays.
5. Should not rely on a “visual” GUI editor or code generator.
   The GUI should be declared in the code.
6. Declarative API using modern C++. Declarative C++ code
   tells you what rather than how (imperative).

Elements, is extremely lightweight… and modular. You compose very
fine-grained, flyweight “elements” to form deep element hierarchies using a
declarative interface with heavy emphasis on reuse.

## Setup and Installation

The Elements C++ GUI library is cross-platform. Follow the [Setup and
Installation guide](setup) to get started using the library.
