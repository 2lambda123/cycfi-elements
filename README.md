# ![Elements-Logo](docs/images/elements.png) Elements C++ GUI library

**Update: Renamed the library to avoid the name Clash with QNX Photon.**

Docs in the making... promise :-) For now, here's a brief introduction: [Elements C++ GUI library](https://www.cycfi.com/2019/07/photon-micro-gui/)

## Setup and Installation

The Elements C++ GUI library is cross-platform, but ports for other
platforms are still in flux. In the Mac, we support both XCode and CLion
IDEs. Get the latest version with a C++17 compiler.

Follow the [Setup and Installation guide](docs/setup.md) to get started using
the library.
