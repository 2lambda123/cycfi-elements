# ![Elements-Logo](docs/images/elements.png) Elements C++ GUI library

**Update: Renamed the library to avoid the name Clash with QNX Photon.**

Still a work in progress, but now I got Windows and Linux ports going in the develop branch.

No docs, still, apart from build instructions for MacOS, but examples provided should be instructive. 
For now, here's a brief introduction: [Elements C++ GUI library](

Nevertheless, I value meaningful discussions, and I am very open to collaboration. 
I invite you to join our mailing list so we can discuss plans, and ongoing developments.

## Setup and Installation

The Elements C++ GUI library is cross-platform, but ports for other
platforms are still in flux. In the Mac, we support both XCode and CLion
IDEs. Get the latest version with a C++17 compiler.

Follow the [Setup and Installation guide](docs/setup.md) to get started using
the library.

The library is Open Source and released under the very liberal [MIT
license](http://tinyurl.com/p6pekvo).
